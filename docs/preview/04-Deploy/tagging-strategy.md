title: Image Tagging Strategy
---

Depending on your scenario you might need a different update cadence for Docker dependencies.

We provide a few options by offering multiple Docker tags:

- **latest** - Ideal for experimentation and proof-of-concepts, but not recommended for running production workloads.
- **{major}.{minor}** - Representation of a specific feature set, but will be updated with feature & security patches.
- **{major}.{minor}.{patch}** - Run a specific version of the runtime. _(Alternative could be to use [image digest pinning](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/pull/#pull-an-image-by-digest-immutable-identifier))

You can also pin to a specific digest of an image to ensure that you are running the same image across your infrastructure.
However, you will not receive security patches unless you use a tool like [Renovate to keep them up-to-date](https://renovatebot.com/blog/docker-mutable-tags).
